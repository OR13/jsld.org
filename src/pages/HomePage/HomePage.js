      What is Linked Data?
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      "In computing, linked data (often capitalized as Linked Data) is
      structured data which is interlinked with other data so it becomes more
      useful through semantic queries. It builds upon standard Web technologies
      such as HTTP, RDF and URIs, but rather than using them to serve web pages
      only for human readers, it extends them to share information in a way that
      can be read automatically by computers. Part of the vision of linked data
      is for the Internet to become a global database."

    <Typography paragraph>
      As a company,{" "}
      <Link href="https://www.transmute.industries/">Transmute</Link> is deeply
      committed to open standards and open source software development. Not only
      does standardization accelerate commercialization, but adhering to
      technical standards protects companies -â€Šby ensuring a level of rigor and
      security agreed upon by technical and industry experts, while mitigating
      the risks of vendor lock in. Standards-compliant technologies that are
      open source expand upon these benefits by engaging a community of
      developers to support, audit, abstract and maintain them.
